# Code Samples for Information Tools

The repo currently contains the following:

## InfoMinder RSS
How to create an RSS feed from InfoMinder alerts and a sample program to consume the feeds. If you find problems or questions, please raise an issue and we will look into it.

## InfoMinder Client 
This directory contains browser scripts (Tamperkey) to modify the behavior of the client. There is one sample script that shows how you can get into edit mode after adding a new URL to track (aka creating a minder)

A note of caution - These browsers scripts have side effects. 

1. Be careful when you add new scripts from unknown sources. There may be security issues. 
1. The broswer scripts seem to slow down the operations somewhat. We are using them for the first time and have some learning to do. 
1. This current script is tested only with Chrome web browser and we do not know whether they work with others like Firefox and IE.
